## A vanilla Rails 2.3.5 installation
This is just so people can do "git clone <github_url> <your_app_name>" instead
of doing "rails <your_app_name>" and messing with gitignore etc. Inspired by
[mislav](http://github.com/mislav)'s 
[kickstart rails](http://github.com/mislav/kickstart-rails), but obviously much less ambitious.
