## A vanilla Rails 2.3.5 installation
This is just so people can do "git clone git://github.com/gabebw/vanilla_rails.git <your_app_name>" instead
of doing "rails <your_app_name>" and messing with gitignore etc.
Inspired by [mislav](http://github.com/mislav)'s 
[kickstart rails](http://github.com/mislav/kickstart-rails), but obviously much less ambitious.
